I'm a systems analyst working in the development of IBM BPM/BPMS services and processes. In a stack of business process modeling, services integration using REST and JS architecture. I appreciate Frontend technologies like Html / Css and JavaScript, this is my playground! So you will find a lot of mess and horrible scripts :trollface: , But learning is a process and I am enjoying it. Feel free to connect to other social networks and send me questions or tips to improve my codes in any of the repositories :octocat: [available here](https://github.com/iurychagas?tab=repositories).
